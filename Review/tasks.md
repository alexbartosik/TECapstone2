## Part 1: Server-Side

Working with the UnitedStates database's City table:

	- Information on the cities should also include the state's name and nickname
	- Order these by the state and then by the city name
	- Verify this in Postman

- Implement an endpoint that allows you to insert a new city
	- Ensure you have validation rules applied on the city model
	- Ensure that this only works for authenticated users
	- Verify this in Postman
